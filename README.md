üõ°Ô∏è MIL-BASTER: Military-Grade Blockchain-Assisted Secure Routing
Next-generation secure routing with dynamic trust management and tamper-proof audit trails for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs)

üéØ Problem Statement
Military communication networks are highly susceptible to sophisticated threats, including data tampering, packet dropping, and identity compromise. Current solutions lack a robust, dynamic trust management system and a tamper-proof mechanism for auditing network anomalies, making them vulnerable to insider attacks and operational disruptions.

‚ö° Our Solution
MIL-BASTER is a comprehensive security framework for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) that integrates real-time anomaly detection, dynamic trust management, and a blockchain-based audit trail. This solution ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and resilience of critical communication, providing a self-healing and secure network environment for military applications.

Key Features:
Real-time Anomaly Detection: Utilizes a sliding window analysis to immediately identify and flag anomalous behavior, such as dropped packets or unauthorized data manipulation.

Dynamic Trust Scoring: Employs a reputation-based system where each node's trust score is dynamically adjusted based on its network behavior.

 ![Trust]((https://media.giphy.com/media/l41lVsYDBC0UVQJCE/giphy.gif))

Successful packet transmission: +1 point

Packet drop or tampering: -20 points

Nodes with a score below 50 are automatically excluded from routing.

Onion Routing with ECC Encryption: Provides a multi-layered cryptographic approach to secure data.

ECDSA Signatures: Ensures data origin authentication and integrity.

ECDH Key Exchange: Establishes secure, ephemeral session keys between nodes.

AES-GCM: Guarantees confidentiality and authenticated encryption of the data payload.

Blockchain Audit Trail: All security-relevant events, including trust score updates and anomaly logs, are recorded on a blockchain. This provides a decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent record for forensic analysis and accountability.

Adaptive Routing: The system intelligently selects the most trustworthy and efficient routing paths, dynamically adapting to exclude compromised or low-trust nodes, thereby enhancing network resilience.

üöÄ Quick Start
To run the MIL-BASTER simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/dynamo-pentester/mil-baster.git](https://github.com/dynamo-pentester/mil-baster.git)
cd mil-baster

2. Set up the Python virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Use 'venv\Scripts\activate' on Windows

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the simulation:
python -m src.sim_runner

üîê Technology Stack
Simulation: Python 3.11 with asyncio for concurrent network simulations.

Cryptography: Implemented using industry-standard libraries for ECDSA, ECDH, and AES-GCM.

Database: SQLite for local node data persistence and PostgreSQL for scalable, production-grade network-wide data management.

Blockchain: A custom Solidity smart contract is deployed on the Sepolia test network, with interactions managed via Web3.py.

Monitoring: Real-time dashboards and logs provide insights into trust scores and anomaly detection events.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The MIL-BASTER architecture is designed for modularity and scalability. Each network node runs a micro-service-based stack:

[MANET Nodes] ‚Üí [Anomaly Detection] ‚Üí [Trust Engine] ‚Üí [SQLite DB]
‚Üì
[Blockchain Integration]

MANET Nodes: Simulates the physical hardware, including communication interfaces.

Anomaly Detection: A service that monitors packet flow and network behavior.

Trust Engine: A core service that calculates and updates node trust scores.

SQLite DB: Stores local trust scores and historical data for quick access.

Blockchain Integration: A service responsible for hashing and logging critical events onto the Sepolia testnet.

Built for defense-grade deployment in UAV swarms, soldier mesh networks, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
